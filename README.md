# BlockList Ethereum Application

A simple classifieds app (e.g. craiglist) built on the Ethereum blockchain.

This application is merely an example that I built in an effort to learn Ethereum/Solidity development, Truffle, Geth, Ganache, and other parts of the web3 stack.

This project was bootstrapped using a barebones Truffle Box which includes bootstrap stylesheets and a basic HTML front-end.
